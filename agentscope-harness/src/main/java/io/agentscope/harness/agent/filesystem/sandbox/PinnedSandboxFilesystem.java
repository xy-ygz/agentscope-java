/**
 * {@link SandboxBackedFilesystem} that holds a fixed {@link Sandbox} reference for the lifetime of

 * <p>Used by asynchronous session mirrors so uploads can complete after the agent call releases
 * its per-call binding on the shared agent proxy. Unlike the agent-level {@link
 * SandboxBackedFilesystem}, {@link #clearSandboxIfCurrent} is a no-op — clearing the call proxy
 * must not unpin this mirror filesystem.
 *
 * <p>Safe for DataAgent-style <em>user-managed</em> sandboxes that stay alive across
 * acquire/release. For self-managed sandboxes, pair with {@link
 * io.agentscope.harness.agent.sandbox.SandboxMirrorReleaseCoordinator} so call teardown defers
 * {@code stop}/{@code shutdown} until outstanding pinned mirror tasks finish.
