# Uninstall the AgentScope Control Plane.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install/uninstall.sh [-n namespace] [-r release] [--purge-crds]
#
# By design Helm does NOT remove CRDs (and the custom resources they own) on
# uninstall. Pass --purge-crds to also delete the CRDs and every Agent/ModelConfig/
# MCPServer/SandboxClaim in the cluster.
#
# Note: Issue collaboration and Session data live in the runtime Store
# (memory or PostgreSQL), not as CRDs. Purging that data is a matter of
# dropping the postgres database/schema (or simply restarting when using the
# in-memory driver); it is not affected by this script.
