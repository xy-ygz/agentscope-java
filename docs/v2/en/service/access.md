title: Accounts, Namespaces and permissions
---

[简体中文](/v2/zh/service/access)

Platform administrators manage accounts and spaces. Resource use and work visibility also depend on Namespace and work-specific permissions.

## Initialize accounts

Release deployments use a configurable bootstrap administrator rather than fixed demo passwords. Change its password in Profile after the first sign-in. Create everyday accounts in Management → Users and grant roles appropriate to their responsibilities.

Profile manages display names, passwords, login sessions, personal connections and subscriptions. A password reset or account suspension can require a new sign-in.

## Namespaces

Use Management → Namespaces to manage shared spaces, members and roles. Users can inspect their effective access; owners and administrators manage members and resources within their authorization. A Namespace is distinct from a file Workspace.

When sharing an Agent, check dependent resource grants too. Visibility of an Agent, Team or Workflow does not make every resulting Issue or Session visible to the same people.

## Diagnose access failures

Check the signed-in account, selected Namespace, resource ownership, current membership and whether the work itself is private. Refresh after grants change. On a version conflict, read the latest configuration before editing again.

Platform administration does not automatically grant access to all private work. Auditing requires the appropriate space permissions. Do not distribute internal service tokens as a substitute for user authorization.
