/**
 * Channel adapter — ingests inbound messages from one messaging platform (or a programmatic
 * caller), routes them through {@link ChannelRouter} to resolve the target agent and session, and
 * delegates execution to {@link Gateway}.
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #init(Gateway)} — called by the gateway bootstrap to inject the auto-wired
 *       {@link Gateway} before start-up. Implementations should store the gateway and perform any
 *       pre-connection setup. The default is a no-op for channels that receive the gateway at
 *       construction time.
 *   <li>{@link #start()} — connects to the external event source (webhook endpoint, long-poll,
 *       websocket, etc.) and begins dispatching inbound messages. Programmatic channels may
 *       implement this as a no-op.
 *   <li>{@link #stop()} — disconnects and releases resources.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Message dispatch</h2>
 *
 * Implementations call {@link Gateway#run} with the {@link
 * io.agentscope.harness.agent.gateway.MsgContext} produced by {@link ChannelRouter#resolveRoute},
 * the resolved {@link OutboundAddress}, and any caller {@link
 * io.agentscope.core.agent.RuntimeContext} carried on {@link InboundMessage#runtimeContext()}.
 * The returned {@link Msg} reply is delivered back to the originating platform by the channel
 * adapter.
