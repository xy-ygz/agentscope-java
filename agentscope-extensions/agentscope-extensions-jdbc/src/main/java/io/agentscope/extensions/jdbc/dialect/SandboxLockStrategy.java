/**
 * Distributed lock contract implemented by {@link AbstractJdbcDialect}.

 * table-based lock (INSERT/DELETE with polling). Vendor dialects with native advisory
 * locks override {@code tryEnter} — e.g. {@code MysqlDialect} uses {@code GET_LOCK} and
 * {@code PostgresDialect} uses {@code pg_try_advisory_lock}.
 *
 * <p>Adding a new database with native lock support requires only overriding
 * {@code tryEnter()} in the vendor dialect class — no separate strategy class needed.
